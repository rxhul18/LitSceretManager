# üîê Hackathon Project at ETHIndia 2024: **Secure AI Crypto Solutions**

Welcome to our project repository! üöÄ At ETHIndia 2024, we tackled some exciting challenges in the world of crypto and AI integration. Here's a quick overview of our journey, challenges, and solutions.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**

We built this solution using the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Crypto Integration:** [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
- **AI Processing:** [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
- **Encryption Tools:** [Lit Protocol](https://litprotocol.com/)

## üåê **How to Run Locally**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rxhul18/LitSceretManager.git
   cd LitSceretManager
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ``` 
2. Ollama must be install and runing in background to get access of AI agent

3. **Environment Configuration:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your configuration:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY = <Your private Key of connected public key>
   NEXT_APP_PUBLIC_LIT_CAPACITY_CREDIT_TOKEN_ID= (optional)
   ```
**Start the Project:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## ‚ö° **Key Challenges and Solutions**

### 1. **Key Encryption and Decryption Not Matching**
**What Happened:**  
While using Lit Protocol‚Äôs encryption tools, the secret key we encrypted didn‚Äôt match the original once decrypted.  

**How We Fixed It:**  
- Discovered that incompatible key formats caused the mismatch.  
- Aligned encryption and decryption processes to use compatible formats.  
- Adopted Lit Protocol‚Äôs recommended encryption methods for seamless functionality.

---

### 2. **Slow AI Performance with Crypto Transactions**
**What Happened:**  
Integrating AI models to optimize crypto transactions led to significant slowdowns, with real-time analysis causing delays.  

**How We Fixed It:**  
- Introduced **parallel processing** for AI tasks.  
- Streamlined data flow and simplified AI models to maintain accuracy while boosting speed.  
- Achieved faster responses without compromising crypto analytics quality.

---

### 3. **Datil Testnet Connectivity Issues**
**What Happened:**  
Intermittent connectivity with the Datil testnet created difficulties in testing key management and transactions.  

**How We Fixed It:**  
- Identified **API rate limits** and slow server responses as the primary issues.  
- Implemented **retry mechanisms** and robust error handling to stabilize the system during testing.
